# Twitter Trading Bot

A trading bot to execute trades based on specific mentions of a ticker by a Twitter user.

## Social Trading Opportunity

This was originally set up to trade DOGE based on Elon Musks tweets but it can be used to monitor any account for any keyword. A trade will be executed if the user tweets a message which includes the keyword.

## Setup

Rename config-example.js to config.js and edit the file using a text editor such as VSCode

You'll need an API key for Twitter: [Twitter Developer Dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/)

You'll also need a FTX API key: [FTX Exchange](https://ftx.com/#a=FTXWELCOME)

Keywords are not case sensitive and you can add #HashTags or $CashTags if you want to isolate those. Be careful because using the keyword "ETH" will execute if Elon starts tweeting about smoking meth.

Using the market: '{KEYWORD}-PERP' will inject a stripped down upper case version of the keyword in to {KEYWORD} position allowing dynamic trading of multiple markets. You can also just trade a single market by changing this to 'DOGE-PERP' or whatever market you wish.

## Command Line Server Setup

```
apt install nodejs
apt install npm
git clone https://github.com/Calfur/Twitter-Trading-Bot.git
cd Twitter-Trading-Bot
mv config-example.js config.js
nano config.js
npm install
node index.js
```

## Additional Info

The code is set to use a trailing stop loss to manage risk. This is setup using a percentage of the price below the current market price. A market order will fire first and on confirmation of execution the trailing stop loss will be set up. This will follow the price up (hopefully) then closing the trade once the price drops back by the amount set.
